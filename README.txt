# Operations Analyst Case Study – Delivery Optimization

This project presents an end-to-end analysis and solution for a real-world business case focused on **reducing Total Order Time** and **improving delivery efficiency** in a fast-growing foodtech startup. It demonstrates strong data analysis, business insight generation, and dashboarding skills using Excel and Power BI.

## Objective

To reduce the **Total Order Time** (from order placement to final delivery) by:
- Analyzing operational data across 24 merchants
- Evaluating delivery performance by vehicle type
- Recommending actionable process improvements

## Insights Extracted

-  **Top Merchants:** Merchant 13, 24, and 1 have fastest order processing.
-  **Slowest Merchants:** Merchant 19, 20, and 14 have significant delays.
-  **Vehicle Performance:** Bikes are faster and more cost-effective than cars.
-  **System-Wide Bottleneck:** On-time delivery rate is only 43% – needs optimization.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** – KPI calculations, pivot tables, and preprocessing
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visuals
- **GitHub** – Documentation and sharing

## Recommendations (Snapshot)

| Area | Problem | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Merchants | High order time | Audit underperformers, replicate fast merchants |
| Logistics | Slow delivery (cars) | Prioritize bikes for short distances |
| System | Pickup delays | Add real-time alerts for drivers |
| Process | KPI visibility | Monthly reports and dashboard automation |

---

## Implementation Plan

**Short-Term (0–3 Months)**:
- Audit slow-performing merchants
- Share merchant performance dashboards monthly
- Prioritize bikes for short deliveries
- Enable driver alerts for pickup readiness

**Long-Term (3–6+ Months)**:
- Route optimization for cars
- Automate KPI tracking dashboards
- Standardize high-performing practices
- Pilot dynamic dispatch system

---

## ✨ Outcome

A structured, data-backed plan to improve speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency of delivery operations using real data and business logic.
